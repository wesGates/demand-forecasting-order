# Plan

Read this first. It says where the project stands, what comes next, what
things cost, and the rules. `GLOSSARY.md` defines the terms; `findings/`
has the numbers.

## Where it stands

The parent repository established that XGBoost, ETS and seasonal ARIMA
beat six benchmarks on one fast-moving item at ten stores (52 weekly
folds), and that a point forecast is not an order. This repository took
that pipeline through nine items:

| item | branch | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1. quantile objective | on main | matches calibrated error quantiles within 0.002 at 26× the cost; ARIMA plus calibration best |
| 2. every day an origin | `item2-fold-step-1` | tables within 0.005; the naïve and drift Sunday bias was an artefact; adopted as the reported layout |
| 3. pooled XGBoost | `item3-pooling` | best method on the fast mover; Q1 improvement 9% against 1.5% per store; bias cut by two thirds |
| 4. intermittent item | `item4-intermittent` | learned models lose at every store; the cause is level drift, which trees cannot extrapolate |
| 5. level-relative target | `item5-level-relative-target` | closes the gap on the declining item (0.570 → 0.501), small gain on the fast mover (0.622 → 0.611) |
| 6. run registry | `item6-run-registry` | `run` and `fold_score` tables beside the cache, suites, `src.run`, paired comparisons |
| 7. parallel harness | `item7-parallel-harness` | one thread per fit, tasks in worker processes; forecasts identical; every-day runs 15 min per item |
| 8. review fixes | `item8-review-fixes` | closure imputation backward-only; events chosen before the cutoff; fallbacks and unscored folds counted; cache checked against the data; `step1` in the key; atomic writes; registry guards |
| 9. both items in one pool | `exp-xgb-quick-wins` | ties on the fast mover, loses on the slow one in holiday weeks; the additive target carries holiday lifts across items, so a shared pool needs a proportional target |

The same branch added two weaker relatives of ARIMA as baselines
(`arima_plain`, no regressors; `arma`, no seasonality, no regressors) and
two dev-suite experiments (`xgboost_poisson`, `xgboost_rel_recent`) that
went no further. The report (`report/report.md`) and the two-page brief
(`report/brief.md`) are built from `tools/report/`.

The numbers to quote are in `findings/2026-09-23-item8-review-fixes.md`.
The ordering prototype (`src/order.py`, notebook 03) is from before item 1
and is where the quantile work continues.

## Next, in order

1. The pooled, level-relative model's own residuals and calibrated
   quantiles (the order step, on the model that won).
2. Intermittent demand properly: a sample of items chosen by demand class,
   Croston and TSB as registered methods (FPP §13.2), results by class, a
   service-level score beside RMSSE, and a per-method minimum history.
3. Pooling wider than one item, on a proportional target (item 9 showed
   the additive target cannot share holiday effects across volumes).
4. New items. The harness needs a year of history per series, so new items
   need their own evaluation: items launched inside the test year, against
   simple fallbacks and pretrained models that need no history.
5. The SQL Server results store and per-forecast explanations (designed,
   below).
6. Fourier terms or an STL decomposition for the annual cycle in the
   classical models (FPP §13.1).

## Designed, not built

**SQL Server as the results store.** SQL Server in a Docker container as
source and sink, in new files only so no cached run is invalidated:

1. sales, calendar, store and item tables loaded from the M5 files, with a
   test that the panel read back equals `load_panel`;
2. a `run` table with one row per cache entry (run id = cache digest,
   method, pooling, layout, item and store scope, code digest, branch,
   commit, full config) and a `forecast` table keyed by run, store, item,
   origin and target date; actuals from a join on the sales table; filled
   by an idempotent sync from the cache and never edited by hand;
3. scoring views (RMSSE, bias, WAPE, MAPE, win rate, quartiles by store and
   kind of week) with a test that they equal the pandas tables;
4. a daily job that reads history up to a date, fits, and writes the next
   seven days; rerunning a date leaves the table unchanged.

Everything keeps running without a database. CI can run the tests against
a SQL Server service container on synthetic series. About 5–6 h.

**Plain-language explanations per forecast.** XGBoost's exact feature
contributions summed into a few groups (recent level, day of week,
holiday, SNAP, time of year), one sentence per forecast, a test that each
explanation adds up to its forecast, and a stability check across adjacent
origins. ETS and ARIMA explain themselves through their components and
coefficients (FPP ch. 8 and 10). An explanation describes the model, not
the customer (FPP §7.8).

**Deferred by the 2026-09-23 review.** The pooled path at hundreds of items
(build the design once per origin and index the pool; one task per fold is
serial over stores); the pooled quantile model refits per store; a worker
exception discards the whole run's rows; whether Martin Luther King Day
(an 18.7% effect) joins the holiday features is an experiment for the
registry.

## Costs

Measured 2026-09-23 under the parallel harness, every core, one thread per
fit.

| layout | all point methods | XGBoost only | ARIMA only |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev`: 3 stores, 8 folds, weekly | ~45 s | ~2 s | ~33 s |
| `weekly`: 10 stores, 52 folds | ~3 min | ~20 s | ~2 min |
| `everyday`: 10 stores, 358 origins | ~15 min | ~2 min | ~10 min |

Two heavy jobs at once contend, so run one at a time. Develop on `dev`,
run `everyday` once per change that survives it, report from `everyday`.
Edits to the harness, the shared base, the features, the loader or the
config invalidate every method's cache, so batch them; `tools/refit_all.py`
remakes every reported run in about 45 min.

## Rules

- No employer, product or third-party document is named anywhere in the
  repository. The words to scan for are kept in the owner's private notes;
  a case-insensitive `git grep` for each must return nothing before a
  commit.
- Commits carry the owner's identity only.
- Every number in a report is read back against the table that produced
  it. The validator and the tests pass first.
- Report voice: third person, technical; cite as (FPP §5.8); say what an
  orderer can do.
- One branch per item, with a findings file; merged after review.
- After a change that touches forecasts, refit and compare
  (`tools/refit_all.py`, `tools/compare_runs.py`, `tools/compare_forecasts.py`)
  before quoting anything.

## Local setup

`~/Documents/projects/demand-forecasting-order`, its own `.venv` (Python
3.14, `requirements.txt`). `data` is a symlink to the parent repository's
data folder. `cache/` holds the runs and the registry and is gitignored.
Figures render to `figures/`, also gitignored; the report keeps its own
copies.
