# # Step 5, continued — From forecast to order
#
# `02_evaluate` scored every method as a *point* forecast with a symmetric
# error. This notebook takes the forecast the rest of the way: to the weekly
# quantity a store would actually order, at a chosen service level, and
# scores that with the metric the decision cares about (FPP §5.5, §5.9).
#
# Like the others it is the *procedure* — it runs unchanged for any item in
# `STUDY_ITEMS`, and prints its findings rather than stating them. What they
# mean for a particular product goes in a dated write-up under `findings/`.
#
# It needs a **two-year** walk-forward: the first year calibrates each
# method's error quantiles, the second is judged. The run is cached, so after
# the first time this loads in seconds.

# ## From forecast to order — FPP §5.5 and §5.9
#
# Everything above scores a *point* forecast with a symmetric error. A
# replenishment decision needs two things it does not have.
#
# **The order is a weekly total.** A Sunday order covers Monday to Sunday, so
# the error that reaches the shelf is the week's forecast total minus the
# week's actual total. Daily errors partly cancel inside a week, and the daily
# RMSSE never sees that they did.
#
# **Ordering the mean stocks out half the time.** A point forecast is the
# centre of what might happen. The quantity to order is a *quantile* — the
# level that covers demand with a chosen probability τ — and which τ is an
# economic question: τ = Cu / (Cu + Co), the understock cost over the sum of
# both. Above 0.5 when running out is the expensive mistake (ambient grocery),
# below 0.5 when holding is (fresh produce that goes in the bin). This item is
# anonymised, so its τ is unknown and a range is reported instead.
#
# **Where the quantiles come from.** Each method's own weekly errors over a
# *calibration year* — the year before the scored one — give it an error
# distribution; its τ-quantile forecast is the point forecast plus the
# τ-quantile of those errors. Every method is treated identically, so a
# benchmark and a model compete on the same footing, and a biased method is
# corrected automatically. Calibrating on the same weeks that are then judged
# would give 90% coverage by construction, which is why the run below has two
# years of folds.
#
# **Pinball loss** (the quantile score, FPP §5.9) is the metric: a unit of
# shortfall costs 2τ, a unit of surplus 2(1 − τ). At τ = 0.9 running out is
# nine times as expensive as over-ordering. Losses at different τ are on
# different scales — read across methods within a column, never along a row.
#
# **What to look for:** whether the *ranking* changes with τ. A method that is
# best at 0.9 and not at 0.3 is the right model for an ambient item and the
# wrong one for a perishable — and RMSSE cannot tell you which is which.
# Then coverage: a calibrated method's 0.9 order covers about 90% of weeks;
# the gap is how well one year's errors described the next.

# ## What this step should have established
#
# The answers go in a dated file under `findings/`, alongside the others:
#
# 1. **How often ordering the mean would have stocked out** — the share of
#    weeks under-forecast, per method.
# 2. **Whether the model ranking survives the move from a symmetric error
#    to an asymmetric cost** — relative pinball by τ, and where the lines
#    cross.
# 3. **Whether the quantiles are trustworthy** — coverage against target,
#    and how much it slips on holiday weeks.
# 4. **What the order would have been** — the weekly band at the busiest
#    store, and which weeks a given service level would have run short.
#
# Only now is it reasonable to write anything up.
