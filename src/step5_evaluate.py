"""
Step 5 - Using and evaluating the forecasts (FPP §1.6, step 5).

This is the harness. It walks every series through every fold, asks every
forecaster for its forecast, and records what actually happened. Everything
reported afterwards - RMSSE tables, win rates, the plots - derives from the one
long table `run_walk_forward` returns, so there is exactly one place where a
forecast meets an actual.

**Walk-forward validation** (FPP §5.10, "time series cross-validation"). The
folds come from `Config.fold_origins`: each is a forecast origin T, and the
`test_window` days after it are scored. Nothing after T is visible to any
forecaster - `Context` carries no future sales, and the learned model's
training rows are filtered by `target_date <= T` in step 4. The folds tile the
held-out period end to end, so the scored days are exactly the ones step 3's
classification never saw.

**RMSSE** (FPP §5.8). Root mean squared *scaled* error: the forecast's RMSE
divided by the RMSE a naive forecast would have had on the training data.

    RMSSE = RMSE(forecast) / sqrt( mean( (y_t - y_{t-lag})^2 ) over training )

A value of 1.0 means "as good as naively repeating the value from `lag` days
ago"; 0.8 means 20% better. Because the denominator is a property of the series
and not of the forecast, RMSSE is comparable across stores of very different
size - a 5-unit error means something different at 100 units/day than at 15.

Two details are `Config` decisions, and the config comments say why:
`rmsse_scale_lag` (FPP says `season` for seasonal data; M5 used 1) and
`rmsse_scale_window` ("pre_holdout": one denominator per series over all
training data before the first scored day, shared by every fold and method).

A property worth having straight: within one series-fold every method shares
the same denominator, so RMSSE **never changes which method wins that fold** -
it is a rescaling of RMSE. What it changes is how you aggregate across stores.

RMSE, MAE and bias are kept alongside as the plain-units view. Bias is
`mean(forecast - actual)`: positive means over-forecasting, and it matters in
its own right for replenishment, where a consistent 5% under-forecast is worse
than noisy-but-centred.

**Two kinds of week.** Every score is also reported split into *normal* and
*holiday* folds. A fold is a holiday fold if any of its scored days falls in
the window from two days before a major event to one day after it - the
run-up and the hangover the event-effect table shows. The split is not there
to hide holidays; it is there because a single pooled number cannot say
whether a method's advantage comes from the fifty ordinary weeks or from the
handful where the calendar does the work. Both columns are reported, always.

**Closure days are not scored.** Step 2 flags the days the stores were shut
and imputes their sales so the following week's features are sane. Those days
are still in `predictions` (so a forecast plot shows them) but `score_folds`
drops them: forecasting a locked door is not a demand question.
