Feature engineering.

One rule governs this entire module:

    **Every feature for a target day must be computable from data available at
    the forecast origin T.**

We forecast days T+1 .. T+h from a single origin T, in FPP's notation
`ŷ_{T+h|T}`. So a row for target day T+h may use:

  - sales up to and including day T, and nothing after it;
  - anything that is known in advance for T+h - the calendar, SNAP dates, the
    horizon h itself.

Getting this wrong is *leakage*, and it produces validation scores that look
excellent and collapse in production. It has already happened once on this
project, so `assert_no_leakage` checks it mechanically rather than by reading.

**Why origin-based rather than target-based lags.** A simpler-looking scheme is
to shift every feature by the horizon and let each target day carry its own
lags. That is leakage-free too, but it means each target day is forecast from a
*different* origin, and the first day of the window throws away six days of data
you would actually have. Here every row in a fold shares one origin, exactly as
a replenishment run does: stand on Sunday, order for Monday through Sunday.

The consequence is that the lag columns are identical across the h rows of a
fold, and `horizon` is what distinguishes them - so `horizon` must be a feature.

Lag choices come from the autocorrelation in step 3 rather than convention: the
weekly harmonics (7, 14, 21, 28) dominate and lag 1 is independently strong.

    mask_holidays
