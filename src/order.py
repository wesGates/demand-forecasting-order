"""
From forecast to order quantity (FPP §5.5, §5.9). The ordering prototype.

This module predates item 1. It is the calibrated-quantile code, and it is
still the only order-quantity code in the repository. Item 1 compared it
with an XGBoost trained on the quantile objective and found that the
calibrated quantiles match the fitted ones within 0.002 relative pinball at
a twenty-sixth of the fitting cost. The quantile work continues from here
(PLAN.md, "the pooled, level-relative model's own residuals and calibrated
quantiles").

What it does, and why:

- The order is a weekly total. A Sunday order covers Monday to Sunday, so
  the error that reaches the shelf is the sum of seven forecasts minus the
  sum of seven actuals. Daily errors partly cancel inside a week and the
  daily RMSSE never sees it. `weekly_totals` builds the quantity the order
  actually is.
- Ordering the mean runs out about half the time. Demand lands above a
  point forecast as often as below it. The quantity to order is a quantile,
  the level that covers demand with a chosen probability τ. Which τ is an
  economic question, the critical fractile τ = Cu / (Cu + Co). Above 0.5
  when running out costs more than holding (ambient grocery), below 0.5 when
  holding costs more (fresh produce that ends up in the bin). M5 items are
  anonymised, so the study reports a range of τ and whether the method
  ranking changes across it.
- Where the quantiles come from. None of the methods produces a
  distribution. FPP §5.5's route works for all of them: a method's own past
  errors are its uncertainty. For each store and method, the weekly errors
  over a calibration year give an error distribution, and the τ-quantile
  forecast for a later week is the point forecast plus the τ-quantile of
  those errors. A method with tighter errors earns a smaller add-on, and a
  biased method gets corrected for free because its mean error is inside the
  distribution.
- Calibration weeks come before scored weeks. Estimating the quantile on
  the weeks it is judged on gives 90% coverage by construction. The run
  that feeds this module scores two years, the first calibrates and the
  second is judged, so every holiday appears in both.
- Pinball loss (FPP §5.9, the quantile score) is the metric, with the
  book's factor of two so that τ = 0.5 equals the absolute error:

      2 τ (y - q)        if y >= q   (under-forecast, a shortfall)
      2 (1 - τ) (q - y)  if y <  q   (over-forecast, a surplus)

  At τ = 0.9 a unit of shortfall costs nine times a unit of surplus. The
  asymmetry the decision cares about sits inside the metric.
- Pinball losses at different τ are on different scales and are never
  averaged across τ. Within one τ they are in units, so the report divides by
  the store's mean weekly sales, for the same reason RMSSE exists.
