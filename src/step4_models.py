"""
Step 4, choosing and fitting models (FPP §1.6). The registry of everything
that produces a forecast, all behind one interface:

    forecaster(ctx: Context) -> np.ndarray of length ctx.horizon

`Context` holds what a forecaster may see and nothing from after the origin.
An earlier build handed a baseline the test frame and one of them quietly
indexed into it. That is the reason for the interface.

Two flat dicts. Adding a method is a function plus an entry.

Benchmarks (FPP §5.2, plus two of our own) are what a model has to beat.
See `benchmarks.py` for why there are six.

Models under test:

  xgboost       gradient-boosted trees on the supervised feature matrix
  xgboost_rel   the same trees on a level-relative target (item 5)
  ets           Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (FPP ch. 8)
  arima         seasonal ARIMA with holiday and SNAP regressors (FPP ch. 9-10)
  xgboost_q*    quantile-objective trees, kept as item 1's comparator

ETS and ARIMA are the two classical families FPP puts forward. the ETS
implementation takes no regressors, so it cannot be told a holiday is
coming, while ARIMA can. Keeping both shows what the calendar information is
worth to a classical model. A plain ARMA is left out on purpose. It is ARIMA
without differencing or a seasonal term, and on daily data with a weekly
cycle it would need very high orders to imitate what one seasonal term does.

Pooling is a training scope rather than a model, and it lives on
`Config.pool_by`. Per-store and pooled XGBoost are the same function with
the same features. The only difference is which rows step 5 puts into
`Context.train_pool` and whether the model is given the store identity.
