"""
Step 2 - Gathering information (FPP §1.6, step 2).

Turns the three raw M5 files into one tidy daily panel: one row per
store-item-date, with the calendar and price information already attached.

Three things in here are not obvious and all three matter:

1. **Filter before melting.** The full panel is 30,490 series x 1,941 days -
   about 59 million rows once reshaped. Subsetting first keeps a notebook
   session responsive without changing the method at all.

2. **SNAP flags are per state.** The calendar carries `snap_CA`, `snap_TX` and
   `snap_WI` as separate columns. Each row must read the column for its own
   store's state, not all three.

3. **Pre-launch zeros are not zero demand.** An item's row spans the whole
   history even before the product was stocked. Those leading zeros mean "not
   for sale", not "nobody bought it". Left in, they teach a model the item sells
   nothing and drag every rolling average down. A missing price is the reliable
   signal: no price on file that week means it was not being sold.

4. **A closure day is a missing observation, not a zero.** Every store in M5
   records zero sales on Christmas Day because the stores were shut. That is
   not demand, and left as a zero it does damage well beyond the day itself:
   the seasonal naive forecast for the following week reads it, every rolling
   mean is dragged down for a week, and ETS takes it as a level shock. FPP
   §13.7 treats such days as missing and replaces them; so does this loader,
   with the same-weekday mean of the surrounding weeks, and it flags the row
   (`closure`) so step 5 can leave it out of the score.

5. **Holiday proximity is a calendar fact, known years ahead.** The loader
   attaches `is_holiday`, `days_to_holiday` and `days_since_holiday` for the
   events that measurably move this item (`MAJOR_EVENTS`, chosen from the
   event-effect table in step 3, not by assumption). A model with only an
   on/off flag cannot learn the run-up before Christmas or Thanksgiving,
   which in this data is as large as the day itself.
