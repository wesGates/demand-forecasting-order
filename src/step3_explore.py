Step 3 - Preliminary exploratory analysis (FPP §1.6, step 3).

FPP is blunt about this: *always start by graphing the data*. Nothing here fits
a model. It answers the questions §1.6 says to ask before modelling - is there a
pattern, a trend, seasonality, outliers, relationships between variables - and
adds the one measurement this project is built around.

**Classifying demand.** "Sporadic and inconsistent" is a judgement until you
measure it. The standard measurement (Syntetos & Boylan) is two numbers:

  ADI  - average demand interval: days divided by days with a sale.
         "How *often* does it sell?"  High ADI = sporadic.
  CV²  - squared coefficient of variation of the non-zero sale sizes.
         "When it does sell, how *consistent* is the amount?"  High CV² =
         inconsistent.

Cut each at its conventional threshold and you get four quadrants:

                 CV² < 0.49          CV² >= 0.49
    ADI <  1.32   smooth              erratic
    ADI >= 1.32   intermittent        lumpy

A caution worth carrying into any discussion of this: 1.32 and 0.49 are
conventions derived from one comparison of forecasting methods, not laws of
nature. A series at ADI 1.31 is not meaningfully different from one at 1.33.
Treat the numbers as continuous and the quadrants as labels of convenience -
which is why `plot_demand_class_map` shows the cloud, not just the buckets.

**Availability comes before intermittency.** A long unbroken block of zero
sales is not sporadic demand - it usually means the item was not on the shelf.
M5 has no inventory data, so the two are indistinguishable from sales alone, and
the pre-launch price trim cannot catch them (these days *have* a price on file).
Left in, they inflate ADI exactly like genuine intermittency and the
classification ends up measuring stocking gaps instead of customer behaviour.

`max_zero_run` measures this so series can be *screened* rather than silently
repaired. That is deliberate: a screen states a selection criterion you can
defend, where a trim would need an arbitrary threshold baked into the pipeline
and would punch gaps into series that lag features would then reach across.

**These are computed on training data only.** The class label is part of the
reported result, so it must not be informed by any day the model is scored on.
`classification_cutoff` returns the first scored date across all folds, and
everything at or after it is excluded.
